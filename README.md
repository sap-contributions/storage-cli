# Storage CLI
This repository consolidates five independent blob-storage CLIs, one per provider, into a single codebase. Each provider has its own dedicated directory (azurebs/, s3/, gcs/, alioss/, dav/), containing an independent main package and implementation. The tools are intentionally maintained as separate binaries, preserving each provider’s native SDK, command-line flags, and operational semantics. Each CLI exposes similar high-level operations (e.g., put, get, delete).

Key points

- Each provider builds independently.

- Client setup, config, and options are contained within the provider’s folder.

- All tools support the same core commands (such as put, get, and delete) for a familiar workflow, while each provider defines its own flags, parameters, and execution flow that align with its native SDK and terminology.

- Central issue tracking, shared CI, and aligned release process without merging implementations.


## Providers
- [Alioss](./alioss/README.md)
- [Azurebs](./azurebs/README.md)
- [Dav](./dav/README.md)
- [Gcs](./gcs/README.md)
- [S3](./s3/README.md)


## Build
Use following command to build it locally

```shell
go build -o <provider-folder-name>/<build-name> <provider-folder-name>/main.go  
```
e.g. `go build -o alioss/alioss-cli alioss/main.go`


## Notes
These commit IDs represent the last migration checkpoint from each provider's original repository, marking the final commit that was copied during the consolidation process.
