# Storage CLI
A unified command-line tool for interacting with multiple cloud storage providers through a single binary. The CLI supports five blob-storage providers (Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS, and WebDAV), each with its own client implementation while sharing a common command interface.

**Note:** This CLI works with existing storage resources (buckets, containers, etc.) that are already created and configured in your cloud provider. The storage bucket/container name and credentials must be specified in the provider-specific configuration file.

Key points

- Single binary with provider selection via `-s` flag.

- Each provider has its own directory (azurebs/, s3/, gcs/, alioss/, dav/) containing client implementations and configurations.

- All providers support the same core commands (put, get, delete, exists, list, copy, etc.).

- Provider-specific configurations are passed via JSON config files.


## Providers
- [Alioss](./alioss/README.md)
- [Azurebs](./azurebs/README.md)
- [Dav](./dav/README.md)
- [Gcs](./gcs/README.md)
- [S3](./s3/README.md)


## Build
Build the unified storage CLI binary:

```shell
go build -o storage-cli
```

Or with version information:
```shell
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=1.0.0" -o storage-cli
```

## Usage

The CLI uses a unified command structure across all providers:

```shell
storage-cli -s <provider> -c <config-file> <command> [arguments]
```

**Flags:**
- `-s`: Storage provider type (azurebs|s3|gcs|alioss|dav)
- `-c`: Path to provider-specific configuration file
- `-v`: Show version

**Common commands:**
- `put <path/to/file> <remote-object>` - Upload a local file to remote storage
- `get <remote-object> <path/to/file>` - Download a remote object to local file  
- `delete <remote-object>` - Delete a remote object
- `delete-recursive [prefix]` - Delete objects recursively. If prefix is omitted, deletes all objects
- `exists <remote-object>` - Check if a remote object exists (exits with code 3 if not found)
- `list [prefix]` - List remote objects. If prefix is omitted, lists all objects
- `copy <source-object> <destination-object>` - Copy object within the same storage
- `sign <object> <action> <duration_as_second>` - Generate signed URL (action: get|put, duration: e.g., 60s)
- `properties <remote-object>` - Display properties/metadata of a remote object
- `ensure-storage-exists` - Ensure the storage container/bucket exists

**Examples:**
```shell
# Upload file to S3
storage-cli -s s3 -c s3-config.json put local-file.txt remote-object.txt

# List GCS objects with prefix
storage-cli -s gcs -c gcs-config.json list my-prefix

# Check if Azure blob exists
storage-cli -s azurebs -c azure-config.json exists my-blob.txt

# Get properties of an object
storage-cli -s azurebs -c azure-config.json properties my-blob.txt

# Sign object for 'get' in alioss for 60 seconds
storage-cli -s alioss -c alioss-config.json sign object.txt get 60s
```

## Contributing

Follow these steps to make a contribution to the project:

- Fork this repository
- Create a feature branch based upon the `main` branch (*pull requests must be made against this branch*)
  ``` bash
  git checkout -b feature-name origin/main
  ```
- Run tests to check your development environment setup
  ``` bash
  ginkgo --race --skip-package=integration --cover -v -r ./...
  ```
- Make your changes (*be sure to add/update tests*)
- Run tests to check your changes
  ``` bash
  ginkgo --race --skip-package=integration --cover -v -r ./...
  ```
- If you added or modified integration tests, to run them locally, follow the instructions in the provider-specific README (see [Providers](#providers) section)
- Push changes to your fork
- **IMPORTANT:** Before writing commit message check [release section](#automated-release-process) and [commit message examples](#commit-message-examples)
  ``` bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  git push origin feature-name
  ```
- Create a GitHub pull request, selecting `main` as the target branch


## Release

Releases are automatically created for Windows and Linux platforms through the `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

### Automated Release Process

When changes are merged into the `main` branch, a new release is automatically triggered. The version number is determined using **semantic versioning** based on conventional commit message prefixes:

**Version Bump Rules:**
- `feat:` - New feature → **Minor version bump** (v1.2.0 → v1.3.0)
- `fix:` - Bug fix → **Patch version bump** (v1.2.0 → v1.2.1)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Breaking changes → **Major version bump** (v1.2.0 → v2.0.0)
- 

**No Release Triggered:**
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config, tooling)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring without behavior changes
- `test:` - Test updates
- `style:` - Formatting and whitespace
- `ci:` - CI/CD configuration changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `build:` - Dependabot commits

### Manual Release

For manual releases (e.g., major version updates or hotfixes), use the GitHub Actions **workflow_dispatch** trigger with a version bump type selector (patch/minor/major).

### Commit Message Examples

```bash
# Patch release (v1.2.3 → v1.2.4)
git commit -m "fix: resolve upload timeout issue"

# Minor release (v1.2.3 → v1.3.0)
git commit -m "feat: add retry logic for failed uploads"

# Major release (v1.2.3 → v2.0.0)
git commit -m "feat: redesign upload API

BREAKING CHANGE: Upload() signature changed to return structured error"

# No release
git commit -m "docs: update Azure Blob Storage usage examples"
git commit -m "chore: upgrade dependencies"
```

## Notes
These commit IDs represent the last migration checkpoint from each provider's original repository, marking the final commit that was copied during the consolidation process.
